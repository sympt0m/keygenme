# keygenme

This is my first attempt at a keygenme. After some positive support, I decided
to release it to the public.

To build, just run `make`. You may need to adjust `config.mk`.

Designed for Linux on a 64-bit platform. A port to Windows should be feasible.

If you are interested in the design, refer to `DESIGN.md`.

**Note**: This program does not implement a secure licensing scheme. If you need
actual protection, refer to ["How are Software License Keys generated?" on
StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/q/3002067) for inspiration.
